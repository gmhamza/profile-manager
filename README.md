# 🎓 Student Profile Manager

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that allows you to manage student profiles using two versions:

* 🖥️ **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** version (`profile.py`)

Both versions store student data (ID, Name, Section, Phone Number) in a JSON file locally.

## 🚀 Features

* Add new student profile
* View all saved profiles
* Remove a student by ID
* Data saved persistently in `profiles.json`
* GUI version with a user-friendly interface
